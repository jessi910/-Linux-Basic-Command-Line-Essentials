 üì° Traceroute Lab ‚Äì Analyzing the Path to Facebook.com
 
üß™ Objective
Use the traceroute command to analyze the network path from the local machine to facebook.com (157.240.221.35) and understand how packets travel across different nodes.

üìú Command Used

traceroute facebook.com
üñ•Ô∏è Raw Output

traceroute to facebook.com (157.240.221.35), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

üîç Analysis
Hops 1‚Äì2: Local and ISP routing ‚Äî shows internal network routing and ISP backbone transit.

Hops 3‚Äì7: The traffic enters Facebook's infrastructure (hostnames ending in .tfbnw.net, which stands for "The Facebook Network").

Hop 8: Shows * * *, meaning that no ICMP response was received. This is common when firewalls or security filters prevent traceroute replies.

Latency: All hops responded with sub-15ms latency, indicating fast and efficient routing to the destination before hop 8.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways

Traceroute is useful for identifying where delays or blockages occur in the network path.

Facebook's infrastructure uses multiple load-balanced paths, as shown by multiple IPs in a single hop.

Some hops may not respond due to firewalls or security policies ‚Äî this does not always indicate an issue.
