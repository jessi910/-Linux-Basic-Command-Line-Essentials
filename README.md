🧠 Skills & Concepts Learned:

📖 Why Linux is Everywhere – Learned about the widespread use of Linux in servers, cybersecurity, cloud platforms, and embedded systems.

💻 First Linux Machine Interaction – Connected to and explored a live Linux environment via a virtual machine (TryHackMe/VirtualBox).

🧾 Fundamental Commands – Practiced ls, cd, pwd, 

📂 Filesystem Navigation – Explored directory structure and how to move between paths efficiently.

🔍 File Searching Tools – Used find, grep, and wildcards to locate files, search inside files, and filter output.
